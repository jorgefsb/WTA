	  		<div class="pregunta"  >1. Order Acceptance and Cancellation</div>
	  		<div class="respuesta" >
	  			Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. We reserve the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept, decline, or limit your order for any reason, whether or not your credit card has been charged. If your credit card has been charged and your order is canceled, we will immediately issue a refund to your credit card account in the amount of the charge and notify you that your order was canceled.<br/><br/>
				Once an order has been placed, it cannot be canceled unless the shipment is unavoidably delayed. In this case, we will do our best to cancel the order if requested.

	  		<div class="pregunta"  >2. Payment Terms, Shipping Fees, and Taxes / Duties</div>
	  		<div class="respuesta" >
	  			Terms of payment are within our sole discretion and, unless otherwise agreed by us in writing, shall be as follows:<br/><br/>
At the time you place your order, you will be required to pay fifty percent (50%) of the amount due as a deposit, exclusive of shipping fees and taxes. We will charge the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the amount due, plus shipping fees, at such time as the Product is ready for shipment. Please be aware that because of the “pre-sale” nature of the transactions on our Website, you should expect a delay of approximately six (6) months between the date you place your order and the date that the Product is ready for shipment.<br/><br/>
If you are shipping within the United States of America, sales tax will be charged on orders shipping to New York State and New Jersey. This tax will be charged at such time as the Product is ready for shipment. No other tax or import duty will be applied to orders shipped within the United States.<br/><br/>
If you are shipping outside the United States on a DDP (Delivery Duty Paid) basis, all relevant import taxes and duties will be charged at such time as the Product is ready for shipment.<br/><br/>
If you are shipping outside the United States on a DDU (Delivery Duty Unpaid) basis, no taxes or duties will be charged by us. As the recipient, you will be liable for all import duties, customs and local sales taxes levied by the country you are shipping to. Payment of these amounts will be necessary to release your order from customs on arrival.<br/><br/>
We accept payment for all purchases through third-party payment processors. You agree to be bound by and accept the terms and conditions of those processors. Further, you represent and warrant that: (i) the credit card information you supply to us, our vendors, and our affiliates is true, correct, and complete; (ii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit card company; and (iii) you will pay charges incurred by you at the posted prices, including all applicable taxes, if any.<br/><br/>
